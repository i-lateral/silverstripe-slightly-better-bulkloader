# Slightly Better Bulkloader

It's the SilverStripe bulk loader, but ever so slightly better!

This module expands the default SS version and adds error logging per import row and attempts to solve issues where Excel sometimes
adds blank columns to the end of a CSV (which then fails to import)

## Install

Instalation via composer:

    # composer require i-lateral/silverstripe-slightly-better-bulkloader
